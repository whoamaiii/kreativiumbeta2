# Testing, CI Thresholds, and Metrics

This project includes performance and bias gating in CI, along with cross-validation metrics and confidence heuristics.

## How to Run Tests

- Unit and integration tests:
  npm test

- Performance tests:
  npm run test:performance

- Bias/fairness tests:
  npm run test:bias

## Overriding CI Thresholds Locally

You can adjust thresholds via environment variables when running tests locally.

- Performance threshold (milliseconds, default 1500):
  CI_PERF_THRESHOLD_MS=1200 npm run test:performance

- Bias disparity tolerance (absolute delta, default 0.08):
  CI_BIAS_TOL=0.05 npm run test:bias

In GitHub Actions CI, these are set in .github/workflows/ci.yml to fail builds on regressions.

## Validation Metrics Interpretation

Cross-validation returns per-fold metrics as well as overall aggregates:
- overallConfusionMatrix (binary classification): The sum of fold-level confusion matrices:
  - tp: true positives
  - tn: true negatives
  - fp: false positives
  - fn: false negatives

- overallPRF1: Derived from the summed overallConfusionMatrix:
  - precision = tp / (tp + fp) when denominator &gt; 0, else 0
  - recall = tp / (tp + fn) when denominator &gt; 0, else 0
  - f1Score = 2 * precision * recall / (precision + recall) when denominator &gt; 0, else 0
  - accuracy = (tp + tn) / (tp + tn + fp + fn) when denominator &gt; 0, else 0

Note: Individual fold confusion matrices are not averaged; only numeric metrics are averaged across folds. The overallConfusionMatrix is computed by summing tp/tn/fp/fn across folds, then overallPRF1 is recomputed from those totals.

## Confidence Heuristics

Confidence is provided as lightweight heuristics, not calibrated probabilities.

- Classification (e.g., sensory predictions with softmax):
  - Maximum softmax probability as a primary confidence signal.
  - Normalized entropy as a secondary signal (lower entropy indicates higher confidence).

- Regression-like/emotion outputs:
  - Inverse variance over outputs, using a small ¬±0.1 interval heuristic to estimate dispersion. Lower variance implies higher confidence.

These heuristics are implemented in src/lib/mlModels.ts and intended to provide relative, quick-to-compute confidence indicators suitable for UI hints or downstream thresholds.
