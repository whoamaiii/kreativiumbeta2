# Advanced Validation Pipeline
# This workflow runs on every push to the main branch
# It performs linting, unit testing, and has placeholders for future performance and bias tests

name: Advanced Validation Pipeline

# Trigger the workflow on push events to the main branch
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

# Define the jobs that will run as part of this workflow
jobs:
  validate:
    # Run on the latest Ubuntu runner
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Define the steps for the validation job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the repository code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Setup Node.js environment
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 18
          cache: 'npm'

      # Step 3: Install project dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      # Step 4: Run the linter to check code quality
      - name: Run linter
        run: npm run lint

      # Step 5: Run unit tests
      - name: Run unit tests
        run: npm test

      # Future tests - currently commented out
      # These will be implemented as part of the Advanced Validation System
      
      # Step 6: Run performance tests (placeholder)
      # - name: Run performance tests
      #   run: npm run test:performance
      
      # Step 7: Run bias detection tests (placeholder)
      # - name: Run bias tests
      #   run: npm run test:bias
