# Test Fixes Summary

## Problem
The test suite was failing with the error:
```
Error: Cannot find module '@testing-library/dom'
```

## Root Cause
The `@testing-library/react` package depends on `@testing-library/dom`, but it wasn't explicitly installed as a dependency. Additionally, there were version conflicts with some packages in the project.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Package Version Issues
- Updated `@nivo/heatmap` from `^0.100.0` to `^0.87.0` (version 0.100.0 doesn't exist)
- Updated `@tensorflow/tfjs-vis` from `^1.5.2` to `^1.5.1` (to match available versions)

### 2. Installed Missing Dependencies
- Installed `@testing-library/dom` as a dev dependency
- Used `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to resolve peer dependency conflicts with `@react-three/drei` and `@react-three/fiber`

### 3. Commands Used
```bash
# Fix package versions in package.json
# Then install dependencies with legacy peer deps flag
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Explicitly install @testing-library/dom
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/dom@latest --legacy-peer-deps
```

## Results
✅ All 16 test files passing
✅ All 86 tests passing
✅ No module resolution errors

## Test Statistics
- **Test Files**: 16 passed
- **Tests**: 86 passed
- **Duration**: ~3.56s
- **Test Categories**:
  - Unit tests for utilities (uuid, logger, storage)
  - Data validation and transformation tests
  - Form validation tests
  - Analytics configuration tests
  - Mock data generator tests
  - Interactive features tests
  - Visual snapshot tests
  - Performance tests
  - Bias testing

## Additional Notes

### Warnings (Non-Critical)
- Some Jest-related packages show engine warnings for Node v23.11.0, but they work correctly
- There's an indexedDB warning in the ML models test, which is expected in the Node.js test environment

### Recommendations for Future
1. Consider adding `@testing-library/dom` explicitly to package.json to avoid future issues
2. Keep package versions synchronized and avoid using non-existent versions
3. Consider using a `.nvmrc` file to specify the exact Node.js version for consistency
4. Add a CI/CD pipeline to catch these issues early

## Accessibility Testing
The project also includes comprehensive accessibility improvements documented in `src/docs/ACCESSIBILITY_IMPROVEMENTS.md`, which ensures:
- Proper ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast and dyslexia-friendly design

The test suite now validates these accessibility features are working correctly.
