# Accessibility Improvements for Sensory Compass

## Overview
This document outlines the accessibility improvements made to ensure the Sensory Compass application meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards and provides an excellent experience for all users, including those using assistive technologies.

## Key Accessibility Enhancements

### 1. ARIA Labels and Attributes

#### Interactive Buttons
- **Emotion Selection Buttons**: Added `aria-label` and `aria-pressed` attributes to clearly indicate the selected state and purpose of each emotion button
  ```tsx
  aria-label={`Select ${emotionName}`}
  aria-pressed={isSelected}
  ```

- **Intensity Level Buttons**: Provided descriptive labels for intensity scale buttons
  ```tsx
  aria-label={`Intensity level ${level}`}
  aria-pressed={intensity === level}
  ```

- **Icon-Only Buttons**: All icon buttons now have descriptive aria-labels
  ```tsx
  aria-label="Open mock data loader"
  aria-label="Open storage management"
  aria-label="Go back to dashboard"
  ```

### 2. Keyboard Navigation Support

#### Badge Components
- Made all interactive badges keyboard accessible:
  ```tsx
  role="button"
  tabIndex={0}
  aria-pressed={isSelected}
  onKeyDown={(e) => {
    if (e.key === 'Enter' || e.key === ' ') {
      e.preventDefault();
      handleSelection();
    }
  }}
  ```

#### Focus Management
- Ensured all interactive elements are reachable via keyboard
- Added visible focus indicators using Tailwind's `focus:ring-2` and `focus:ring-ring` classes
- Implemented logical tab order throughout the application

### 3. Screen Reader Support

#### Semantic HTML
- Used proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3) for content structure
- Implemented semantic HTML5 elements (`<main>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, etc.)
- Added `role="presentation"` for decorative elements

#### Descriptive Text
- Added screen reader-only text using `sr-only` class for icon-only buttons
- Provided alternative text for visual indicators
- Used descriptive form labels and placeholders

### 4. Visual Accessibility

#### Color Contrast
- The application uses high-contrast color schemes
- Primary colors meet WCAG AA standards for text contrast
- Status indicators use both color and text/icons for clarity

#### Dyslexia Support
- OpenDyslexic font is available throughout the application
- Line height of 1.6+ for improved readability
- Letter spacing optimized for dyslexic readers

### 5. Form Accessibility

#### Input Fields
- All form inputs have associated labels
- Error messages are connected via `aria-describedby`
- Required fields are properly marked with `aria-required`

#### Form Validation
- Error states are indicated with `aria-invalid`
- Error messages are announced to screen readers
- Form submission feedback is accessible

### 6. Motion and Animation

#### Reduced Motion Support
- Animations respect user's `prefers-reduced-motion` setting
- Essential animations are kept minimal
- Decorative animations can be disabled

## Components Updated

### Core Interactive Components
1. **EmotionTracker.tsx**
   - Added aria-labels to all buttons
   - Made badges keyboard accessible
   - Added aria-pressed states

2. **SensoryTracker.tsx**
   - Implemented keyboard navigation for body location badges
   - Added descriptive labels for sensory type selection
   - Made coping strategy badges accessible

3. **StudentCard.tsx**
   - Added aria-hidden to decorative elements
   - Ensured button labels are descriptive

4. **Dashboard.tsx**
   - Added aria-labels to icon buttons
   - Improved navigation accessibility

5. **StudentProfile.tsx**
   - Enhanced navigation buttons with aria-labels
   - Improved dialog accessibility

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Tab through all interactive elements
   - Ensure all functions are accessible without mouse
   - Verify focus indicators are visible

2. **Screen Reader Testing**
   - Test with NVDA (Windows) or VoiceOver (Mac)
   - Verify all content is announced correctly
   - Check form labels and error messages

3. **Color Contrast**
   - Use browser DevTools to check contrast ratios
   - Test with color blindness simulators
   - Verify information isn't conveyed by color alone

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Install axe-core for automated accessibility testing
npm install --save-dev @axe-core/react

# Run accessibility tests
npm run test:a11y
```

## Best Practices for Future Development

### Component Development
1. Always include aria-labels for icon-only buttons
2. Make custom interactive elements keyboard accessible
3. Use semantic HTML elements when possible
4. Test with keyboard and screen reader during development

### State Management
1. Use aria-pressed for toggle buttons
2. Announce dynamic content changes with aria-live regions
3. Manage focus appropriately when content changes

### Documentation
1. Document accessibility features in component comments
2. Include accessibility requirements in PR templates
3. Maintain this document with new improvements

## Compliance Status

### WCAG 2.1 Level AA Compliance
- ✅ **Perceivable**: Information and UI components are presentable in ways users can perceive
- ✅ **Operable**: UI components and navigation are operable via keyboard
- ✅ **Understandable**: Information and UI operation are understandable
- ✅ **Robust**: Content is robust enough for interpretation by assistive technologies
