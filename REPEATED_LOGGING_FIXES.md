# Repeated Logging Fixes Summary

## Problem
The `useAnalyticsWorker` hook and related components were causing repeated logging of the same messages, especially during:
- Component re-renders
- Analytics processing
- Worker communication

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Component Mount Logging**: Debug logs were placed directly in `useEffect` hooks that run on every dependency change
2. **Cache Hit Logging**: Every cache hit was being logged, even for the same cache key
3. **Worker Communication**: Worker messages were logged on every analytics run
4. **Initialization**: The fallback mode message was logged on every component mount

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **AnalyticsDashboard Component** (`src/components/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`)
- Separated component mount logging into its own `useEffect` with empty dependency array
- This ensures mount logging happens only once per component instance

### 2. **useAnalyticsWorker Hook** (`src/hooks/useAnalyticsWorker.ts`)
- **Cache Hit Logging**: Added rate limiting to only log cache hits once per cache key per minute
- **Fallback Mode Logging**: Limited to once per hour using cache-based tracking
- **Worker Posting Logs**: Rate limited to once per minute
- **Worker Message Logs**: Rate limited to once per minute per cache key
- **Initialization Logging**: Used global window flag to log fallback mode only once per app session

### 3. **Analytics Worker** (`src/workers/analytics.worker.ts`)
- **Message Received Logging**: Rate limited using worker cache to log once per cache key per minute
- **Removed Redundant Logging**: Removed unnecessary timeWindow logging

### 4. **Global TypeScript Declaration** (`src/types/global.d.ts`)
- Added proper TypeScript declaration for the global window flag used for one-time logging

## Implementation Details

### Rate Limiting Strategy
- Uses the existing performance cache to track which log messages have been shown
- Log tracking entries have special keys (prefixed with `_logged_`) and TTL values
- Different log types have different rate limits:
  - Initialization: Once per session
  - Fallback mode: Once per hour
  - Cache hits: Once per minute per cache key
  - Worker messages: Once per minute

### Benefits
1. **Reduced Console Noise**: Significantly fewer duplicate messages in the console
2. **Better Performance**: Less string formatting and console output overhead
3. **Preserved Debugging**: Important messages still appear, just not repeatedly
4. **No Functional Changes**: Only logging behavior was modified, not application logic

## Testing
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- All logging still functions but with proper rate limiting
- No impact on application functionality
