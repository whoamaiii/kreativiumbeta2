  - `src/hooks/useAnalyticsWorker.ts` - Added `[WORKER_MESSAGE]` tracking for postMessage

### 2. Console Statement Replacement
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/lib/analyticsExport.ts` - Replaced console.error with logger.error

### 3. Blob URL Memory Management
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/lib/analyticsExport.ts` - Updated to use `downloadBlob` utility for proper cleanup
  - Already had proper cleanup in `src/lib/utils.ts` and `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`

### 4. Environment Variable Updates (Vite Compatibility)
- **Files Modified**:
  - `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` - Replaced `process.env.NODE_ENV` with `import.meta.env.DEV`

  - `src/lib/logger.ts` - Replaced `process.env.NODE_ENV` with `import.meta.env.PROD`

### 5. Verified Component State Management
- **No Issues Found**:
  - `selectedScenario` in MockDataLoader is actively used for scenario selection
  - `showSettings` in AnalyticsDashboard is properly implemented with settings dialog
  - Event listeners in Dashboard.tsx have proper cleanup in useEffect return

### 6. Verified ID Generation
- **No Issues Found**:
  - Mock data generator uses proper UUID generation via `generateId` from `src/lib/uuid.ts`
  - Uses crypto.randomUUID() when available, preventing race conditions

## Key Improvements
1. **Better Observability**: Added diagnostic logging to track resource lifecycle
2. **Memory Leak Prevention**: Ensured all Blob URLs are properly revoked
3. **Vite Compatibility**: Replaced Node.js environment variables with Vite equivalents

### 11. **Performance Optimizations Applied**
- **File**: `scripts/cleanupProfileSections.ts`
  - **Fix**: Replaced console statements with proper logger service for script usage

- **File**: `src/components/AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`
  - **Optimizations Applied**:
    - Added React.memo with custom comparison function to prevent unnecessary re-renders
    - Added useCallback to handleExport function for better performance
    - Custom comparison checks student ID, name, and data array lengths
    - Deep comparison only performed when array lengths match

- **File**: `src/components/DataVisualization.tsx`
  - **Optimizations Applied**:
    - Added React.memo with custom comparison function
    - Added useMemo for expensive data processing operations:
      - Emotion data aggregation and processing
      - Sensory data aggregation and processing
      - Pie chart data calculation
    - Custom comparison prevents re-renders when data hasn't actually changed
    - Added displayName for better debugging experience

- **File**: `src/hooks/useAnalyticsWorker.ts`

- **Improvements Added**:
  - Added `isLoadingModels` state to show loading spinner during initial ML model status fetch
  - Added `isDeletingModel` state to track deletion progress with proper UI feedback
  - Implemented loading states in the ML models tab UI:
    - Shows "Loading ML models..." spinner during initial load
    - Shows "Deleting..." spinner on Delete button during model deletion
    - Disables action buttons during async operations to prevent duplicate actions
  - Added proper error handling with toast notifications for failed operations
  - Fixed React fragment closing issue in the ML models section

### 14. **Virtual Scrolling Verification**
- **Status**: Already properly implemented

  - `OptimizedStudentList` component uses virtual scrolling for large lists
  - No additional implementation needed

## Next Steps to Complete

1. **Add Loading States to More Components**:
   - MockDataLoader async operations
   - Other components with async data fetching
   - Form submissions and data updates

2. **Code Splitting and Lazy Loading**:
   - Implement React.lazy for route-based code splitting
   - Add Suspense boundaries with loading fallbacks
   - Optimize bundle sizes for faster initial load

3. **Bundle Size Optimization**:
   - Analyze bundle with webpack-bundle-analyzer or similar
   - Tree-shake unused dependencies
   - Consider dynamic imports for heavy libraries
